 Star11 takes great care to comply with all central and state legislation in India to ensure that our users are fully protected. Every contest on our platform is carefully designed to comply with applicable statutes and regulations in India.<br><br>
 Below are the key points from an Indian High Court’s judgement specifically regarding Star11's game. A challenge to this judgement was also dismissed by the Supreme Court of India:<br><br>
 
 1.The Court, in its ruling, stated that playing the Star11 game involves considerable skill, judgement and discretion and that success on Star11 arises out of users’ exercise, superior knowledge, judgment and attention<br><br>
 2.The Court also held that ‘the element of skill’ had a predominant influence on the outcome of the Star11 game, which follows the following format:<br>
 a.Participants have to choose a team consisting of at least the same no. of players as playing in a real-life sports team (e.g. 5 in basketball, 7 in kabaddi and 11 in cricket/football)<br>
 b.All contests are run for at least the duration of one full sports match<br>
 c.No team changes are allowed by participants after the start of the sports match
 
 <br>
 <br>
 On this basis, the Court adjudged that playing on Star11 constitutes a ‘game of mere skill’, which makes the Star11 game exempt from the provisions of the Public Gambling Act, 1867 (PGA).<br>
 <br>
 	3.Finally, the Court held that the Star11 is a legitimate business activity protected under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.
