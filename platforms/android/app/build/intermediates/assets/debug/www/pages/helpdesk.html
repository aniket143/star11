    You can follow the below steps to place a withdrawal query

  - Step 1: Login with your verified Star11 account

  - Step 2: Go to My Account and if your account is a verified account you will see a  “Withdraw” option under the winnings section.

  - Step 3: Click Withdraw and enter the amount you would like to withdraw. You will receive a confirmation from Star11 on your registered email id.

  You can withdraw money only from the winnings balance once your Star11 account is verified. You cannot withdraw the cash amount but you can use it to join more contests and win more. This verification is a one-time process which doesn’t need to be repeated unless you wish to make changes to your account. We need you to provide the following bank account details: Name of the bank, Name of the branch, Name of the account holder, account no. and IFSC code. Once your account is verified, you can withdraw the desired amount (min. of Rs.200 and max. of Rs.2,00,000 at a time) and it will be deposited into your bank account within 5 working days.

Step 5. You can browse through the various cash contests at the match centre & join any of them. You can also create your own contest & invite friends to play with you.

Once the match starts, your created team will score points based on the real-life performance of your chosen players in the match.

Your rank in a cash contest is decided based on the points your team earns during the live match. If your team finishes amongst the winning ranks of that cash contest, you’ll be declared a winner in the contest. We’ll credit the winnings in your Star11 account, depending on the amount that you’ve won.

Please note that cash bonus will NOT count towards levelling up. Only the amount used from the “Unutilized” or “Winnings” balance will count.
