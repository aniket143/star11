  <p>Any player who is sent off by the umpires for serious misconduct governed by the ICC Playing Conditions for International Matches (effective Sept 28, 2017) will score and retain points on Dream11 according to our standard points system for his contribution during his time on the field. If the player is allowed to take the field later in the same match, he will once again be eligible to score points for the duration of his stay on the field.

</p>
<strong>How do I know if a contest has a single winner or more than one winner?</strong>
<p>A contest with more than one winner or multiple winners will be denoted by the crown icon.
</p>
<strong>How many winners will be announced for contests with multiple winners?</strong>
<p>The winners will vary for different contests. The number of winners in a contest will be shown by clicking on the 'Multiple Winners' link and this information will be disclosed as soon as the contest is made available to join.

<p>The prize money that each winner will receive is explained in detail on clicking the 'Multiple Winners' (M) link for that contest. Please note that taxes will be deducted as applicable on winnings above Rs. 10,000 as per government regulations.
</p>
<strong>What happens if there is a tie between winners of a multiple winner contest?</strong>
<p>In case of a tie between winners of a multiple winner contest for any position, the prize money for the winner's position and the immediately next winning position (if any), and so forth in accordance with the number of tied winners, will be aggregated and shared equally among the tied winners. All other prize money will remain as per the winner's standing.<br>For example: If there are 2 winners tied for the 1st position, the sum of the 1st and 2nd position prize money will be distributed equally between these 2 winners and the next highest scorer will be awarded the prize money for the 3rd position.
Currently, there are no tie breakers and hence all teams who have scored equal points will be considered as tied for a position.
</p>
<strong>What happens if an ODI/T20 match is abandoned?</strong>
<p>If the real match is abandoned fantasy match will be cancelled and the entry fees will be refunded. This includes scenarios where the real match is abandoned without a single ball being bowled, as well as where the match is abandoned after it has started.
</p>
<strong>Notes:</strong>
<p>If the real match has a result (i.e., ends in a win to either team or a tie but not a "no result") even if not played out fully, we will announce the results of the fantasy match as per the fantasy scorecard points accumulated, except where a result or progression of a team in the tournament is a consequence solely of (i) the results of a Super Over or Bowl Out, (ii) the toss of a coin, (iii) prior results between or relative standings of the teams in the tournament, or (iv) any methodology other than those envisaged by the official score revision rules (e.g., Duckworth Lewis Stern) applicable to weather affected matches in the particular tournament. Where a fantasy match has been cancelled for the aforesaid reasons, or any other reasons as may be notified from time to time, the entry fees of all participants in such match will be refunded in full. For the sake of clarity, the scores of a Super Over shall not be tabulated for the purpose of fantasy scorecard points under any circumstances.
</p>
<strong>What happens if a test match is declared as drawn?</strong>
<p>If the real test match is declared as drawn with neither of the teams completing a single inning, the fantasy match will be cancelled and the entry fees will be refunded.
If the real test match is declared drawn with either team (and not necessarily both) completing a single inning, the fantasy match will be considered to have completed and the entry fees will not be refunded.
</p>
<strong>Notes:</strong>
<p>An innings will be deemed to be completed if a batting team either declares or gets bowled out (i.e., loses ten wickets) in such innings.
</p>
<strong>What if the contest doesn’t fill up with required number of participants?</strong>
<p>In case of a cash contest, the contest will be cancelled and the entry fee will be refunded to your account. But where’s the fun in that? So, make sure to invite maximum friends to join the contest and fill the required slots!
</p>
<strong>What do I win in a practice contest?</strong>

</p>
<strong>What do I win in a cash contest?</strong>
<p>Real cash! What can be better than that?</p>
<strong>Why do ranks keep fluctuating during a contest?</strong>
<p>As the players perform in the real-life match, your team keeps earning points for your chosen players’ performances. The points status appearing next to your total points indicates if the match is in progress or completed.
</p>
<strong>Can I get my friend(s) to join the same contest in which I am playing?</strong>
<p>There is nothing better than friends competing against each other in the same contest! That’s why we have private contests wherein you can invite your friends through email or you can share a unique code on your or Facebook wall to participate in the same contest.
</p>
<strong>Can I join future matches and contests in advance?</strong>
<p>Considering the excitement and passion of cricket fans, we allow our users to pre-select their teams for all the matches that are open on Dream11 at any given point of time.
</p>

To view your opponent’s team, go to the ‘Joined contests’ tab for a match and click on your opponent’s team name. You can also track your competitors by downloading the details of other teams in that contest.
</p>
<strong>Can I join a contest in the middle of the series?</strong>
<p>Of course, the beauty of the daily format is that you can join a contest in the middle of a series that is not yet closed (deadline has not passed) and have an equal opportunity of winning as everyone else.
</p>
<strong>Do I have to create a separate team for each contest?</strong>
<p>Yes! You are required to create a separate team for each new contest.
</p>
<strong>How do you decide the winner of a contest?</strong>
<p>The team which gets the highest points at the end of the match will be announced as the winner of that contest.
</p>
<strong>Why do you charge me a fee to enter a contest?</strong>
<p>We charge a platform fee to access our amusement facilities for improving and maintaining the facilities, as well as awarding cash prizes.<br>However, the entry fee will be credited back to your Dream11 account in case of cancelled matches due to abandoned matches.

  <strong>How will I be informed if I win a Cash prize?</strong>
  <p>Ranks and points will be updated and displayed during and at the end of every match. If you win in any cash contest, the winnings will be credited automatically to your Dream11 account balance.
  </p>
  <strong>When will the winnings be distributed?</strong>

Our dedicated team manually verifies the fantasy cricket scorecard with our live cricket feed to ensure that the points and scores are correctly updated after every match. This procedure can sometimes take a relatively long time. Only after we are sure that all points and scores are accurate, the final points are updated and winners are declared.
  </p>
  <strong>
Does the amount in my Winnings Account have any expiry date?</strong>
<p>If the amount in your Winnings Account is not withdrawn to your bank account within 335 days from the date of credit, it will be deposited automatically to your bank account which is on record with Dream11, provided that your Dream11 account has verified by Dream11. In case no bank account is provided or you have failed to complete the verification for the Dream11 account, the amount would stand forfeited by Dream11.
