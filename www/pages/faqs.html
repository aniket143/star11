You will score points depending on how the players in your team perform in the live match. So, make sure you pick a winning combination to help you win! Check out our ‘Fantasy Points System’ section on the ‘How to play’ page to know more.
<br><br>

   Points are awarded to your team only when the live match begins.  
<br><br>
<strong>Which website do you refer to update the points?</strong> <br>
   We get our live score feed from reliable sources. All our points are typically calculated using this live feed. However, we may also refer to other scorecards and live score feed such as governing bodies to correct and verify the score feed & ensure accurate tabulation of points.

<br><br>
<strong>How do I know if a contest has a single winner or more than one winner?</strong>
<br>A contest with more than one winner or multiple winners will be denoted by the crown icon.
<br><br>
<strong>How many winners will be announced for contests with multiple winners?</strong>
<br>The winners will vary for different contests. The number of winners in a contest will be shown by clicking on the 'Multiple Winners' link and this information will be disclosed as soon as the contest is made available to join.

<br>The prize money that each winner will receive is explained in detail on clicking the 'Multiple Winners' (M) link for that contest. Please note that taxes will be deducted as applicable on winnings above Rs. 10,000 as per government regulations.
<br><br>
<strong>What happens if there is a tie between winners of a multiple winner contest?</strong>
<br>In case of a tie between winners of a multiple winner contest for any position, the prize money for the winner's position and the immediately next winning position (if any), and so forth in accordance with the number of tied winners, will be aggregated and shared equally among the tied winners. All other prize money will remain as per the winner's standing.<br>For example: If there are 2 winners tied for the 1st position, the sum of the 1st and 2nd position prize money will be distributed equally between these 2 winners and the next highest scorer will be awarded the prize money for the 3rd position.
Currently, there are no tie breakers and hence all teams who have scored equal points will be considered as tied for a position.
<br><br>
<strong>What happens if an ODI/T20 match is abandoned?</strong>
<br>If the real match is abandoned fantasy match will be cancelled and the entry fees will be refunded. This includes scenarios where the real match is abandoned without a single ball being bowled, as well as where the match is abandoned after it has started.
<br><br>
<strong>Notes:</strong>
<br>If the real match has a result (i.e., ends in a win to either team or a tie but not a "no result") even if not played out fully, we will announce the results of the fantasy match as per the fantasy scorecard points accumulated, except where a result or progression of a team in the tournament is a consequence solely of (i) the results of a Super Over or Bowl Out, (ii) the toss of a coin, (iii) prior results between or relative standings of the teams in the tournament, or (iv) any methodology other than those envisaged by the official score revision rules (e.g., Duckworth Lewis Stern) applicable to weather affected matches in the particular tournament. Where a fantasy match has been cancelled for the aforesaid reasons, or any other reasons as may be notified from time to time, the entry fees of all participants in such match will be refunded in full. For the sake of clarity, the scores of a Super Over shall not be tabulated for the purpose of fantasy scorecard points under any circumstances.
<br><br>
<strong>What happens if a test match is declared as drawn?</strong>
<br>If the real test match is declared as drawn with neither of the teams completing a single inning, the fantasy match will be cancelled and the entry fees will be refunded.
If the real test match is declared drawn with either team (and not necessarily both) completing a single inning, the fantasy match will be considered to have completed and the entry fees will not be refunded.
<br><br>
<strong>Notes:</strong>
<br>An innings will be deemed to be completed if a batting team either declares or gets bowled out (i.e., loses ten wickets) in such innings.
<br><br>
<strong>What if the contest doesn’t fill up with required number of participants?</strong>
<br>In case of a cash contest, the contest will be cancelled and the entry fee will be refunded to your account. But where’s the fun in that? So, make sure to invite maximum friends to join the contest and fill the required slots!
<br><br>
<strong>What do I win in a practice contest?</strong>

<br><br>
<strong>What do I win in a cash contest?</strong>
<br>Real cash! What can be better than that?<br><br>
<strong>Why do ranks keep fluctuating during a contest?</strong>

<br><br>
<strong>Can I get my friend(s) to join the same contest in which I am playing?</strong>
<br>There is nothing better than friends competing against each other in the same contest! That’s why we have private contests wherein you can invite your friends through email or you can share a unique code on your or Facebook wall to participate in the same contest.
<br><br>
<strong>Can I join future matches and contests in advance?</strong>

To view your opponent’s team, go to the ‘Joined contests’ tab for a match and click on your opponent’s team name. You can also track your competitors by downloading the details of other teams in that contest.
<br><br>
<strong>Can I join a contest in the middle of the series?</strong>

<br><br>
<strong>Do I have to create a separate team for each contest?</strong>
<br>Yes! You are required to create a separate team for each new contest.
<br><br>
<strong>How do you decide the winner of a contest?</strong>

<br><br>
<strong>Why do you charge me a fee to enter a contest?</strong>

This procedure can sometimes take a relatively long time. Only after we are sure that all points and scores are accurate, the final points are updated and winners are declared.
<br><br>
  <strong>
Does the amount in my Winnings Account have any expiry date?</strong>
<br>If the amount in your Winnings Account is not withdrawn to your bank account within 335 days from the date of credit, it will be deposited automatically to your bank account which is on record with Star11, provided that your Star11 account has verified by Star11.
