              <tbody>
              <ul>
              <li>Step 1: Login with your verified Star11fantasy account.</li>

    <li>Step 2: Go to My Account and if your account is a verified account you will see a “Withdraw” option under the winnings section.</li>

    <li>Step 3: Click Withdraw and enter the amount you would like to withdraw. You will receive a confirmation from Star11fantasy on your registered email id.</li>

    <li>You can withdraw money only from the winnings balance once your Star11fantasy account is verified. You cannot withdraw the cash amount but you can use it to join more contests and win more. This verification is a one-time process which doesn’t need to be repeated unless you wish to make changes to your account. We need you to provide the following bank account details: Name of the bank, Name of the branch, Name of the account holder, account no. and IFSC code. Once your account is verified, you can withdraw the desired amount (min. of Rs.200 and max. of Rs.2,00,000 at a time) and it will be deposited into your bank account within 7 working days.</li>
    <p><strong><ins>Can I use someone else’s bank account to withdraw money?</ins></strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, you can withdraw money from your Star11fantasy account balance ONLY to your own bank account. If you do not have a bank account, your winnings will keep getting accumulated in your Star11fantasy account balance. Once you get a bank account in your name, you can use the same to get your Star11fantasy account verified and place your withdrawal requests.</p>
<p><strong><ins>It’s been over 7 working days but I’ve still not received the withdrawal in my bank account?</ins></strong></p>

<p>Please make sure that you are checking the same bank account which you have submitted during your bank verification. The payout entry in your bank statement.</p>
<p>In case you do not receive the payout post 7 working days of the withdrawal request, your withdrawal may have been rejected by your bank. The most common reason for the rejection may be an incorrect account number, wrong IFSC code, NRI account etc.</p>

<p>In case there has been a rejection, we have you covered! We’ll reverse the money back into your Star11fantasy account so that you can update your details and place a new withdrawal request again.</p>

<p><b>Please write to us using the link below mentioning the withdrawal request date and the amount.</b></p>

<p><strong><ins>Do I have to pay taxes when I withdraw money to my bank account?</ins></strong></p>

<p>Taxes are deducted at source wherever applicable and paid out by us, as per the Income Tax Act 1961. Thus, if your individual winnings for a single contest are more than Rs.10,000, a tax of 31.2% will be deducted. The remaining amount (68.80%) will be credited to your winnings balance. For e.g. If you win Rs.1,00,000, Rs.31,200 will be deducted and your actual winnings are Rs.68,800</p>

<p>Winners will be provided TDS certificates in respect of such tax deductions, if applicable. However, you shall be responsible for payment of any other applicable tax, including but not limited to, income tax, gift tax, etc. in respect of the Cash Prizes money won. If you have any queries regarding taxation, we strongly suggest that you consult with a tax expert. For more information please check our Terms and Conditions.</p>

              <p>Points are usually updated every few minutes! However, when the match ends, the status changes from ‘In Progress’ to ‘Waiting For Review’. In this time, the final points including your team’s total and your rank are updated. Winners are declared and winnings are distributed only after our team verifies the final points. This process may take up to 2 hours. In certain cases, it could take longer. After the winners are declared, the match status will be ‘Completed’.</p>

<p><strong><ins>How will I score points?</ins></strong></p>

<p>You will score points depending on how the players in your team perform in the live match. So, make sure you pick a winning combination to help you win BIG! Check out our detailed Points System to understand how to score on Star11fantasy.</p>
<p><strong><ins>What happens when a ODI/T20 match is abandoned or not played out fully?</ins></strong></p>
<tbody>
<ul>
<li>If the real match is abandoned, the match will be cancelled and the entry fees will be refunded. This includes scenarios where the real match is abandoned without a single ball being bowled, as well as where the match is abandoned after it has started.</li>
<li>If the real match has a result even if not played out fully, we will announce the results of the match as per the fantasy scorecard points accumulated, except where a result is a consequence solely of (i) the results of a Super Over or Bowl Out, (ii) the toss of a coin, (iii) prior results between or relative standings of the teams in the tournament, or (iv) any methodology other than those envisaged by the official score revision rules (e.g., Duckworth Lewis Stern) applicable to weather affected matches in the particular tournament.</li>
</ul>
</tbody>
<p><strong><ins>What happens when a match is tied?</ins></strong></p>

<p>When a match is tied, winners are still declared at the end of the match on the basis of the points and ranks of users participating in the contest.</p>

<p><strong><ins>Why are my team’s points/ranks not updated correctly?</ins></strong></p>

<p>Points/ranks can sometimes take a bit longer than usual to reflect. However, the final scores, points and rankings are reflected once the match is completed. We also verify the points with live score feeds provided by reliable sources to ensure that the points/ranks are correctly reflected after every match.</p>

<p>Step 1. Select a sport</p>

<p>Step 2. Choose a match from the ‘Fixtures’ tab</p>

<p>Step 3. Create your team within a virtual budget of 100 credits before the deadline</p>

<p>Step 4. Now, join any of our Practice Contests to hone your skills or Cash Contests to win BIG</p>

<p>Step 5. You can browse through the various cash contests at the match centre & join any of them. You can also create your own contest & invite friends to play with you.</p>

<p>Once the match starts, your created team will score points based on the real-life performance of your chosen players in the match.</p>

<p>Your rank in a cash contest is decided based on the points your team earns during the live match. If your team finishes amongst the winning ranks of that cash contest, you’ll be declared a winner in the contest. We’ll credit the winnings in your Star11fantasy account, depending on the amount that you’ve won.</p><br>

<p><strong><ins>How many teams can I create for a single match?</ins>
</strong> </p>

<p>You can create upto 6 different teams for a match and join a Multi-Entry contest with all 6 teams. However, every entry with a new team will require a separate entry fee. You can also choose to switch between the teams (team 1/team 2 etc.) before the deadline for every match.</p><br>



<p><strong><ins>What is the use of a Captain/Star Player in a team?</ins></strong></p>

<p>A true Captain /Star Player leads by example! The player you choose to be your team’s Captain/Star Player will earn 2 times the points and the Vice-captain you choose for cricket and football will earn 1.5 times the points for his performance. So, choose wisely.</p><br>

<li>When you win in a cash contest, your winnings will be added to your Star11fantasy account balance within 5 hours of the live match being completed. However, for matches ending late at night, winnings will be added to your account balance the next morning</li>

 <tbody>
<ul>
<li>If any of the contest is not filled with the required number of participants or if the real match is abandoned the contest will be cancelled and we will refund the entry fee if joined to your Star11fantasy account within maximum 24hrs.</li>

<li>If contests have been cancelled for the below reasons, or any other reasons as may be notified from time to time, the entry fees of all participants in such match will be refunded in full within 24hrs.</li>

<li>If the real match is abandoned, all contests for the match will be cancelled and the entry fees will be refunded in full within 24 hrs. This includes scenarios where the real match is abandoned without a single ball being bowled, as well as where the match is abandoned after it has started.</li>

<li>If the match has a result (i.e., ends in a win to either team or a tie but not a “no result”) even if not played out fully, we will announce the results of the contests as per normal, except where a result or progression of a team in the tournament is purely decided by:</li>

 <li>the results of a Super Over or Bowl Out,</li>

<li>the toss of a coin,</li>

<li>prior results between or relative standings of the teams in the tournament, or</li>

<li>any methodology other than those envisaged by the official score revision rules (e.g., Duckworth Lewis Stern) applicable to weather-affected matches in the particular tournament.</li>
</ul> </tbody>

<p>For the sake of clarity, the scores of a Super Over shall not be considered towards rankings under any circumstances.</p>

<p><strong><ins>How will I be informed if I win a Cash prize?</ins></strong></p>

Ranks and points will be updated and displayed during and at the end of every match. If you win in any cash contest, the winnings will be credited automatically to your Star11fantasy account balance.</p><br>



<p><strong><ins>When will the winnings be distributed?</ins></strong></p>

<p>The winner declaration and crediting of the winnings to your Star11fantasy account usually happens within a couple of hours after the match is completed. Our dedicated team manually verifies the Star11fantasy scorecard with our live feed to ensure that the points and scores are correctly updated after every match. This procedure can sometimes take a relatively long time. Only after we are sure that all points and scores are accurate, the final points are updated and winners are declared.</p><br>



<p><strong><ins>Does the amount in my Winnings Account have any expiry date?</ins></strong></p>

<p>If the amount in your Winnings Account is not withdrawn to your bank account within 335 days from the date of credit, it will be deposited automatically to your bank account which is on record with Star11fantasy, provided that your Star11fantasy account has verified by Star11fantasy. In case no bank account is provided or you have failed to complete the verification for the Star11fantasy account, the amount would stand forfeited by Star11fantasy. Hence it’s important that you get your Star11fantasy account verified as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Note: You can join contests even without verifying your account. When you win Cash Contests, your winnings will be deposited in your Star11fantasy account.

The minimum winnings balance needed to place a withdrawal request is Rs. 200.</p><br>



<p><strong><ins>Can I verify more than one account with same PAN Card and bank account?</ins></strong></p>

<p>Creating multiple accounts violates our FairPlay policy and hence you cannot verify multiple accounts using same PAN and bank details.</p><br>


<p><strong><ins>Why do I need a PAN Card to verify my account?</ins></strong></p>

<tbody>
<ul>
    <li>Your withdrawals involve transfer of money from your Star11fantasy account to your bank account. Hence, PAN Card is mandatory to get your account verified, due to regulatory requirements.</li>

<tbody>
<ul>
    <li>You did not upload an image of your PAN Card Your withdrawals on Star11fantasy involve a transfer of money. Hence, PAN Card is mandatory to get your Star11fantasy account verified. Please upload a clear image of your PAN Card.</li>

    <li>PAN number on the card does not match the PAN number entered during verification request Double check the PAN number that you have entered to avoid errors</li>

   <li> Date of Birth on the PAN Card does not match the Date of Birth on your Star11fantasy account. Please ensure that you enter the exact Date of Birth on the verification request as it appears on the PAN Card</li>

   <li> Name on the PAN Card does not match the name on the bank account You can withdraw money from your Star11fantasy account only to your own bank account. Hence, the name on the PAN Card and bank account need to match.</li>

    <li>IFSC code provided in the bank details is incorrect/belongs to a different bank branch than the one mentioned for verification purposes. If you provide the wrong IFSC code, your money could be transferred to account belonging to someone else. So, make sure you enter the correct code. You can find the IFSC code in your cheque-book, passbook or bank statements. If you are not sure, please contact your bank to get the correct code.</li>

   <li> The documents uploaded by you are not clear/visible. Our experts are humans after all! Please help them by uploading documents where all the details are clearly visible so that they can verify your details quickly.</li>

    <li>Bank account number entered in verification request does not match with account number appearing on the uploaded proof.

Invite your friends via Whatsapp, Facebook, email and more and get up to Rs. 100 cash bonus per friend! The more cash contests your friends join, the larger your cash bonus (max. up to Rs.100 per friend).</p>

<p>Remember: your friend MUST enter your invite code correctly <b>DURING </b>registration as this a mandatory step to link his/her account to yours.</p>

<p>Additionally, both you & <b>your friend MUST download the app</b>, verify your mobile number to earn the Rs.100 cash bonus.</p>

<p>You can invite as many friends as you like. The more the merrier.</p>

<p><strong><ins>How do I earn the referral bonus?</ins></strong></p>
<tbody>
<ul>
<li>Once your invited friends join cash contests on Star11fantasy, you will get a cash bonus equal to 1/3rd of their entry fee. For example, if your friend has joined a cash contest with Rs.15 entry fees, you will receive a cash bonus of Rs. 5 in your Star11fantasy account. Remember, you can earn a maximum cash bonus of Rs.100 from each invited friend.</li>
<li><b>Remember: The cash bonus will be credited to your account after the winners of the match (your friend has joined cash contests for) are declared (within 48 hours).</b></li><br>
</ul></tbody>


<p><strong><ins>My friend has registered using my invite code and played cash contests as well. When will I start getting my referral bonus?</ins></strong></p>

<tbody>
<ul>
<li>Your friend must be displayed in your Invite Friends dashboard to make you eligible for the bonus. Please visit the Invite Friends section in the menu and then click on the link at the bottom of the screen to locate your Invite Friends Dashboard.</li>

    <li>Once you find your friend in the list, relax! <b>Please note that you will get the applicable cash bonus in your account within 48 hours after the winners of the match (your friend has joined cash contest/s in) are declared.</b></li>

<li>You will receive 1/3rd of the total amount your friend has joined cash contest/s with (maximum Rs.100 from each friend).</li>

    <li>In case your friend is not showing up in your Invite Friends list, he/she may have missed entering your invite code during registration on the Android app. In this scenario, he/she would not have received the invite a friend bonus as well.</li>

    <li>If you believe that your friend has entered your code during registration and is still not showing in your invite friends dashboard, please ask him/her to contact us via their Star11fantasy account mentioning the issue along with your invite code.</li>
    </ul>
    </tbody>

 

<p><strong><ins>My cash bonus/invite code has been blocked. How do I unblock it?</ins></strong></p>

<p>Our system would have detected FairPlay Violation on your Star11fantasy account due to which the cash bonus and invite code gets blocked. This usually happens when an invite code is used to create multiple (fake) accounts on Star11fantasy.</p>
<p>We suggest that you follow the following steps to unblock your Cash Bonus / referral (invite) code. <b>Please make sure that you are using the latest Android app.</b></p>

<p><strong>To unblock cash bonus:</strong></p>
<tbody>
<ul>
    <li>Log into your account</li>

    <li>From the bottom menu, goto ‘Me’ –> ‘My Account’</li>

    <li>Click on ‘How to Unblock’ and follow the instructions.</li>

<p><strong>To unblock invite code:</strong></p>

    <li>Select ‘Invite Friends’ from the ‘More’ menu on the bottom right.</li>

    <li>Click on ‘How to Unblock’ and follow the instructions.</li>
</ul>
</tbody>

<p><strong><ins>I registered using a referral code however I did not receive any cash bonus. Why?</ins></strong></p>

<p>In order to get the referral bonus, you need to enter a valid invite code (shared by your friend) during registration. If you have missed entering it during registration, unfortunately, you are not eligible for the bonus.</p>

<p>However, you can get a cash bonus by inviting your friends and getting them to register using your invite code (max bonus of Rs. 100 per friend). You can find your invite code by visiting the Invite Friends section in the menu.</p>

<p>In case you correctly entered the invite code shared by your friend during registration, but have not received your bonus yet, <b>send us the invite code using the below link and we will help you out.</b></p>

<p><strong><ins>I forgot the mobile number/email id I used to register on Star11fantasy.</ins></strong></p>

<p>If you have forgotten your registered email id, you can login using your registered (verified) mobile number. An OTP will be sent to you on that number, which you can use to login successfully.</p>

<p>If you have forgotten your registered mobile number, you can login with your email, Facebook and Google ids as well.</p>

 

<p><strong><ins>I am not receiving the OTP.</ins></strong></p>

<p>The OTP is usually sent within 30 seconds. If you haven’t received it in that time, you may probably be in a low network zone. You can request for a new OTP by clicking on the ‘Resend OTP’ link that appears after 30 seconds. Alternately, you can login using your registered email id and password or via Facebook or Google.</p>

<p>If none of these steps are working, please check your connection and retry once you have better connectivity.</p>

<p><strong><ins>When I try to login using my mobile number, I am receiving an error that the mobile number does not exist.</ins></strong></p>

<p>From an account security point of view, your mobile number needs to be verified. This is because login via mobile number requires OTP authentication and only verified mobile numbers are allowed to use this feature.</p>

<p>No worries if your mobile number is not verified yet. You can login first using your registered email id, Facebook or Google id and then get your mobile number verified by visiting the Verification section in the App/website. Once the mobile verification is successful, you can login with your registered mobile number.</p>

<p><strong><ins>How do I change my password?</ins></strong></p>

<p>Simple! Please go to <b>Me –> Full Profile/Personal Details</b>to change your password. In case you have forgotten your existing password, you will need to reset it from the login page. The steps to reset password are mentioned in the reset password FAQ above.</p>
