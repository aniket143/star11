    You can follow the below steps to place a withdrawal query<br>

  - Step 1: Login with your verified Star11 account<br>
 - Step 2: Go to My Account and if your account is a verified account you will see a  “Withdraw” option under the winnings section.<br>

 - Step 3: Click Withdraw and enter the amount you would like to withdraw. You will receive a confirmation from Star11 on your registered email id.<br>

 - You can withdraw money only from the winnings balance once your Star11 account is verified. You cannot withdraw the cash amount but you can use it to join more contests and win more. This verification is a one-time process which doesn’t need to be repeated unless you wish to make changes to your account. We need you to provide the following bank account details: Name of the bank, Name of the branch, Name of the account holder, account no. and IFSC code. Once your account is verified, you can withdraw the desired amount (min. of Rs.200 and max. of Rs.2,00,000 at a time) and it will be deposited into your bank account within 7 working days.

    - PAN number on the card does not match the PAN number entered during verification request Double check the PAN number that you have entered to avoid errors<br>

    - Date of Birth on the PAN Card does not match the Date of Birth on your Star11 account. Please ensure that you enter the exact Date of Birth on the verification request as it appears on the PAN Card<br>

    - Name on the PAN Card does not match the name on the bank account You can withdraw money from your Star11 account only to your own bank account. Hence, the name on the PAN Card and bank account need to match.<br>

     - IFSC code provided in the bank details is incorrect/belongs to a different bank branch than the one mentioned for verification purposes. If you provide the wrong IFSC code, your money could be transferred to account belonging to someone else. So, make sure you enter the correct code. You can find the IFSC code in your cheque-book, passbook or bank statements. If you are not sure, please contact your bank to get the correct code.<br>

    - The documents uploaded by you are not clear/visible. Our experts are humans after all! Please help them by uploading documents where all the details are clearly visible so that they can verify your details quickly.<br>

    - Bank account number entered in verification request does not match with account number appearing on the uploaded proof. Please ensure that you enter the exact bank account number in the verification request, as it appears on the bank account proof. In the rare case that your verification request gets rejected, the reason for rejection will appear on top of the verification page for your reference.</p>

    - You did not upload an image of your PAN Card Your withdrawals on Star11f involve a transfer of money. Hence, PAN Card is mandatory to get your Star11 account verified. Please upload a clear image of your PAN Card.<br>

    - PAN number on the card does not match the PAN number entered during verification request Double check the PAN number that you have entered to avoid errors<br>

    - Date of Birth on the PAN Card does not match the Date of Birth on your Star11 account. Please ensure that you enter the exact Date of Birth on the verification request as it appears on the PAN Card<br>

    - Name on the PAN Card does not match the name on the bank account You can withdraw money from your Star11 account only to your own bank account. Hence, the name on the PAN Card and bank account need to match.<br>

    - IFSC code provided in the bank details is incorrect/belongs to a different bank branch than the one mentioned for verification purposes. If you provide the wrong IFSC code, your money could be transferred to account belonging to someone else. So, make sure you enter the correct code. You can find the IFSC code in your cheque-book, passbook or bank statements. If you are not sure, please contact your bank to get the correct code.<br>

    - The documents uploaded by you are not clear/visible. Our experts are humans after all! Please help them by uploading documents where all the details are clearly visible so that they can verify your details quickly.<br>

    - Bank account number entered in verification request does not match with account number appearing on the uploaded proof. Please ensure that you enter the exact bank account number in the verification request, as it appears on the bank account proof. In the rare case that your verification request gets rejected, the reason for rejection will appear on top of the verification page for your reference.</p>

<p><b>I forgot the mobile number/email id I used to register on Star11f.<br>

If you have forgotten your registered email id, you can login using your registered (verified) mobile number. An OTP will be sent to you on that number, which you can use to login successfully.<br>

If you have forgotten your registered mobile number, you can login with your email, Facebook and Google ids as well.</b></p>
<p><b>I am not receiving the OTP.</b><br>
The OTP is usually sent within 30 seconds. If you haven’t received it in that time, you may probably be in a low network zone. You can request for a new OTP by clicking on the ‘Resend OTP’ link that appears after 30 seconds. Alternately, you can login using your registered email id and password or via Facebook or Google.<br>

If none of these steps are working, please check your connection and retry once you have better connectivity.<br>

<p><b>When I try to login using my mobile number, I am receiving an error that the mobile number does not exist.</b>

From an account security point of view, your mobile number needs to be verified. This is because login via mobile number requires OTP authentication and only verified mobile numbers are allowed to use this feature.<br>

No worries if your mobile number is not verified yet. You can login first using your registered email id, Facebook or Google id and then get your mobile number verified by visiting the Verification section in the App/website. Once the mobile verification is successful, you can login with your registered mobile number.
